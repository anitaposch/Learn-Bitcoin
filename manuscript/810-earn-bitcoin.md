# Earn Bitcoin
Earning Bitcoin is actually the best way to acquire it: limited or no registration, limited or no KYC identity check and no trading fees. Some of these services are only available in the US or other specific regions of the world. Since the Bitcoin space is in rapid development, this chapter can only be a lookout for what is to come.

## Content Creators and Podcasting 2.0
With the advent of the Lightning Network, a truly groundbreaking new method of sending value and paying for content on the internet has been invented. Streaming money, a term coined by Andreas M. Antonopoulos, enables musicians, video creators and podcasters to earn money in real-time, without intermediaries. You only need a wallet that has podcasts integrated, a little bit of bitcoin and you can start listening while paying by the minute. The goal of Podcasting 2.0 and streaming money is to free content creators and the audience from ads, censorship and surveillance. Paying is voluntary, with no subscription fees and no prepayment. Be aware that at the time of writing these are all services in constant development.
