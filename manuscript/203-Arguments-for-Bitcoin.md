## Arguments for Bitcoin
> "Bitcoin is an opt-in system. You choose to use it. You choose what apps you're going to run. You choose who you're going to interact with. You choose the rules of the game by which you're going to interact. That's why bitcoin is going to win. It delivers innovation that consumers want and need." - 
> **Andreas M. Antonopoulos**

### A Paradigm Shift
I'm a digital native individual in a Gen X body. I can remember life without the internet, even without a VCR. We had one TV station in Austria, that was it. My parents got our first landline phone when I was 12. At 14 I used my first computer, in 1997 I installed my first internet connection and email at home. That same year there were only 1 million websites globally and Google and Amazon did not exist internationally.

A lot of people dismissed the internet as a trend that would go away. In 1995, US astronomer and author Clifford Stoll wrote an article for Newsweek titled "The Internet? Bah!"

>"Then there's cyberbusiness. We're promised instant catalog shopping - just point and click for great deals. We'll order airline tickets over the network, make restaurant reservations and negotiate sales contracts. Stores will become obsolete. So how come my local mall does more business in an afternoon than the entire Internet handles in a month? Even if there were a trustworthy way to send money over the Internet - which there isn't - the network is missing a most essential ingredient of capitalism: salespeople." - **Clifford Stoll** [^56]

Fast forward to 2019 and Amazon is in the top ten biggest companies in the world, Google and YouTube are the biggest search engines and there are 1.8 billion active websites. My first contact with Bitcoin and blockchains was in April 2017 when I heard a talk by Shermin Voshmgir. It clicked immediately. 20 years after I changed my career from being an urban planner to becoming an internet entrepreneur, I understood that Bitcoin is as massive as the dawn of the internet in 1997.

The discovery of Bitcoin was the advent of a new technology on top of the internet that we use for media and communication. The internet of money, which allows us to exchange value globally without boundaries. Communication over the internet has changed the world massively in the last few decades. What do you think the impact of the free movement of value will have? Bitcoin and other open, public digital assets will shift the power dynamics between nations since it is suddenly possible to move huge amounts of money at speed, without friction or touching the current financial system.

Bitcoin is a new technology. If we compare its development to the internet, we are pretty much where the internet was in 1997.

### Enabling Social Change

People in developed nations with functioning democratic systems often dismiss Bitcoin as a tool for speculation and a danger for nation-states. Therefore, some think its electricity consumption is environmentally irresponsible. Some even advocate for a ban. Expect this kind of criticism to increase in the coming years.

The world's population is 7.8 billion people. Only 8.4% of those live in full democracies, 41% in flawed democracies, 15% in hybrid regimes and 35,6% in authoritarian regimes.

Over 50% of the world's population are living in nations far from free and fair democracies! 1.7 billion people do not have a bank account and never will. Bitcoin is for them. [^57]

It's people in regions like Africa and South America who will drive Bitcoin adoption forward. The main use-cases there are:

**Hedge Against Inflation**
This table by the International Monetary Fund shows the annual change of consumer prices in percent.

*Figure* [^58]
{height: "50%"}
![Inflation rate, average consumer prices, annual change in %](resources/_inflation-2021.png) 

* Venezuela saw prices increases by 5,500%. The suffering of the people is simply incomprehensible.
* In Sudan the prices increased 200% in 2021 alone.
* Zimbabweans faced a doubling of prices at 100% inflation from 2020 to 2021.
* The IMF did not have data for Argentina, but I was informed by my Argentinian interview partner, Franco Amati, the annual inflation rate was 50%.
* Nigeria saw an inflation rate of 16% in 2020.
* Turkey's inflation rate in 2020 was 13.6 %.

From May 2020 to April 2021 the bitcoin trading volume in Nigeria increased by 40% from $287 million to $399 million. A 2020 survey shows that 32% of Nigerians who were interviewed had used or owned cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, in developed democratic countries like Germany and the USA, only 5-6% have used or owned cryptocurrencies.

*Figure* [^59]
![Trading volume on P2P Bitcoin exchanges in Sub-Saharan countries from May 2020 to April 2021](resources/_Nigeria-trading-volume-BTC.png) 

Given these annual inflation rates, people know that they need to store their wealth in harder money like USD, and better still, Bitcoin. If you explain the differences of Bitcoin to local currencies in these countries, everybody understands immediately how and why Bitcoin can support them.

**Foreign Exchange Controls**

Countries with weak economies and flawed democracies use foreign exchange controls to limit - what they call - speculation against their weak currencies. Since authoritarian leaders want to limit and control people's possibilities to circumvent their oppressive systems, they apply regulations such as the following:

* Argentina's capital controls only allow people to exchange a maximum amount of $200 per month from Argentine Pesos to USD.
* Quite the same harsh regulations apply in Zimbabwe. If you run a business and need to import goods, you must ask the Reserve Bank for permission to send USD abroad. "Suppose I'm in solar power and I want to buy 20 panels so that I can sell them. I only have 30 days to spend down on the money that I already had. The Reserve Bank can take as long as it wants to give me permission to even go and resupply. That's another reason why the US actual physical dollars, the physical cash has so much more value in Zimbabwe", a Zimbabwean interview partner told me in March 2020.

**Banking System Is Not Available or Broken**
* Local businesses in Zimbabwe are allowed to use USD to bill a local supplier. That supplier has to liquidate those US dollars within 30 days, or the money gets converted into their RTGS account at the bank rate. RTGS is the name for the Zimbabwean dollar, which shows these high inflation rates.
* If you buy foreign currency at an Argentinian bank the official bank exchange rate is used (which is favorable for the bank, but not the customer) and on top of that a 65% tax is deducted.
* Using the banking system can be full of red tape in Western countries too, but it's much worse in those countries.

**Remittances**
* If you receive money from abroad through the traditional banking system it will be converted to Argentine pesos at the official bank rate. This basically represents a confiscation of 30% of the value.
* In 2020 as much as 1 billion USD have been sent as remittances to Zimbabwe. Over one-third of the population relies on remittances from relatives abroad. A lot of Zimbabweans live in South Africa and of the money they send, up to 20-30% are lost through banking fees and official exchange rates. [^60]

**Barriers for Women**
Using a basic bank account is beyond the reach of almost one billion women worldwide. Varying degrees of gender inequality permitted or mandated by law deny women full financial participation in many countries around the world. Depending on the country, women are discriminated against in inheritance laws and are required to obtain their husband's permission to legally work, get a bank account, register a business or sign a contract; many women are banned from entering certain professions. Women may also find it more difficult to access legal ID cards due to existing laws or restrictive registration requirements, and such identification is commonly required to use financial products and services.

Other hurdles that prevent women from accessing financial services are the need to travel long distances, the risk of being robbed while accessing money, and lack of privacy that would allow them to protect their savings from others.

"Over 80 percent of the small business conducted in the Pacific by women is in little marketplaces," said Dr. Sharman Stone, Australia's Ambassador for Women. "When they only had cash it was extremely dangerous for them to get that cash home, and to retain that cash once they got home." [^61] With Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, they are physically safer, can circumvent inflation and hold their own money.

> Women are the majority of Kenya's population; they perform 70% of the agricultural labor, but they own less than 1% of the land and control very little of the income produced by their labor. [^62]

56% of all unbanked adults globally are women. Women are overrepresented among the unbanked in most economies. This is true even in economies that have successfully increased account ownership and have a relatively small share of adults who are unbanked. [^63] In the United States, Middle East and North Africa two-thirds of the unbanked are women.[^64]

A study in Kenya found that access to mobile money services delivered big benefits, especially for women. It enabled women-headed households to increase their savings by more than one fifth, allowed 185,000 women to leave farming and develop business or retail activities and helped reduce extreme poverty among women-headed households by 22 percent.

Mobile money services like M-Pesa in Kenya or EcoCash in Zimbabwe have increased access to financial instruments. The problem: these are services by centralized, private companies. The government can interfere, transactions can be censored or accounts can be closed. As an example, in July 2020 the Zimbabwean government blocked pay-outs from EcoCash mobile money accounts to bank accounts or cash.

Financial services can also help people accumulate savings and increase spending on necessities. After being provided with savings accounts, market vendors in Kenya, primarily women, saved at a higher rate and invested 60 percent more in their businesses. Women-headed households in Nepal spent 15 percent more on nutritious foods (meat and fish) and 20 percent more on education after receiving free savings accounts. Moreover, farmers in Malawi who had their earnings deposited into savings accounts spent 13 percent more on farming equipment and increased their crop values by 15 percent. [^65]

Bitcoin can lower the cost of receiving payments, leaving people with more of their money. While traditional financial instruments require an ID and proof of address, using Bitcoin is open to everyone. Therefore, Bitcoin can support women in gaining more freedom and self-sovereignty.

### Slow, But Safe
One criticism of Bitcoin is that its development is slow and clunky. In fact, reality shows that Bitcoin is the longest standing and technically safest blockchain. It has never been hacked or altered. The reason for this is a community of independent, open-source developers whose first interest is to contribute to the broader social good. Listen to [Adam Back](https://anita.link/12) anita.link/12, [Gloria Zhao](https://anita.link/82) anita.link/82, [Tim Akinbo](https://anita.link/63) anita.link/63, [Amiti Uttawar](https://anita.link/62) anita.link/62 or [Matt Corrallo](https://anita.link/19) anita.link/19 to understand how thoughtful and driven they are by their mission. Secondly, the pace of development is deliberately slow. The Silicon Valley mantra of "Move fast and break things" is the opposite of what you want for a 600 billion USD digital asset that is at the same time, live software.

### Internet of Things
An internet native money like bitcoin can be used by machines too. Self-driving electric cars like auto-taxis will be able to recharge themselves at charging stations and pay automatically with bitcoin. This is not science fiction, this is the near future. Andy Schroder from Kentucky is [loading his Tesla with real-time machine-to-machine micropayments over the Bitcoin Lightning Network](http://andyschroder.com/DistributedCharge/) http://andyschroder.com/DistributedCharge/ already. This will not be the only innovation that will come from the intersections of new technology, money and communication.

### Bitcoin, the Life-Boat
As I laid out in chapter 1, it's not a question of whether the current financial system will fall, but when. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic spread globally in spring 2020, nations were in deep debt; the devastating effects were evident in the global and regional wealth gaps. For many years experts have warned the public about it. Simon Dixon had already called out the Great Depression of the 2020s already in 2011. Nomi Prins explained the central banks' collusion in her 2018 book of the same name. Satoshi Nakamoto referred to the dangers of a monetary system built on debt and the financial crisis in the white paper.

Bitcoin is debt-free money. One does not simply inflate the supply. It's the perfect alternative to opt-out of the fiat system. In order to hedge against this looming crisis, it makes sense to distribute investments among different assets and thus reduce systemic risk. Gold, equities, bonds, real estate, watches and vintage cars are well-known value protection assets. Bitcoin is a digital value protection asset.

When CEOs of publicly traded companies like Elon Musk and Michael Saylor began to exchange USD cash holdings for bitcoin, they secured their place on the Bitcoin life-boat. Bitcoin was made for individuals. For people like you and me. Now is your chance to exit the sinking boat of fiat currencies. It's not too late, you're still early.

### Bitcoin Is Common Good
The Bitcoin network is a public infrastructure; it is a decentralized communications network that is still being built right in front of our eyes. We as individuals could not participate financially, directly from the build out of the internet. Most of us did not own shares of Apple, Google or Facebook. Many hurdles exclude billions of people from investing in start-ups. Bitcoin is open for everyone to invest in its infrastructure. You can also use houses to imagine Bitcoin being digital property; there are only 21 million houses and you can buy a fraction of a house, right down to a door handle.

### Bitcoin Encourages Saving
Bitcoin is ideal for long-term saving. If you believe that the value is going to rise in the future, you are encouraged to hold and not to spend your bitcoin on things that are not really necessary.

### You Can Afford Bitcoin
You don't have to buy a whole bitcoin. A bitcoin is divisible to a hundred million units. The smallest unit is called a "Satoshi" - after the pseudonymous founding figure, Satoshi Nakamoto. You can buy parts of a bitcoin and start with as little as 20 euros, for example.

### Bitcoin and the Functions of Money
Many textbook economists are insisting on the fact that Bitcoin is not money because it does not fulfill the three functional criteria that money must have. These functions were defined by William Stanley Jevons[^66] in 1875, his analysis becoming widely popular in macroeconomic textbooks ever since.

According to Jevons, Bitcoin is only money if it fulfills these functions: [^66a] 
1. Store of value - the value must remain stable over time
2. Medium of exchange - it is widely accepted in exchange for goods and services
3. Medium of account - it is used as a measure for prices, costs and profits

**1. Store of Value**
Critics say bitcoin is not a store of value due to its volatility and potential for short-term losses. Well, as I laid out in chapter 3.1, in the long-term that is not really the case. Further, I question the definition of "stable over time". What is the time frame? Inflation in fiat money in Austria has been 20% over the last decade. All other fiat currencies like the Euro are similarly unreliable stores of value for this very reason.

**2. Medium of Exchange**
You can use bitcoin as a medium of exchange if you want to. Yes, there is only a small number of companies, services and restaurants that accept bitcoin as a payment at the time of writing. But, to do this, you could use different tools and services that you can fill with bitcoin and spend in fiat. On top of that, there are a lot of companies inside the space that already accept and pay wages in bitcoin too.

**3. Medium of Account**
Fiat money is required to be the medium of account by law. We simply do not have a choice. Bitcoin is based on voluntary use, it is opt-in; if we speculate that the value is going up, we won't spend it. Since the volatility of bitcoin becomes less over time, one day value will hit a plateau and people will start spending bitcoin. Even earlier than this, more and more businesses will start to accept bitcoin, since they will trust that it does not lose value but rather appreciates.

A new form of money that is not forced upon us, but is an opt-in, has to go through certain stages in that order: first, it has to become a store of value, then trust has to be built, then people will use it as a medium of exchange. Only then it will be used as a medium of account.

Dismissing Bitcoin because it does not yet fulfill all the functions of money is missing the point.

### Comparing the Traits of Money

In 2014 Ryan Walker took the concepts of Darwin's theory of natural selection to compare the evolution of the different forms of money. The table below displays the degree to which gold, fiat and bitcoin fulfill the traditionally recognized traits of money (row 1 - 8). Government issued measures the degree of centralization and control by authorities (row 9).

> "The arrival of cryptographic-based currencies has enabled key new traits previously not possible with traditional forms of money. Furthermore, the realization of such traits will likely have a dramatic impact on the environment in which these currencies compete. Row 10 and 11 include the specie of cryptocurrency when rated against the traditional and newly realized traits of money." - **Ryan Walker**

*Figure* [^67]
![The traits of money](resources/_table-characteristics-money.PNG)
This shows the degree to which gold, fiat, and cryptographic currencies fulfill the traditionally recognized traits of currency as well as the new traits made possible by the discovery of Bitcoin.

As you can see, Bitcoin goes beyond the traditional framework of what money is. It's evolving into a completely new dimension of what money can do and from which applications will be built upon in the future.
