136-satoshi-nakamoto change in text:

Hal Finney, an American cryptography and computer expert, had long been involved in the concept of digital money. However, none of the previous solutions were technically or conceptually mature enough to be used widely. The news from Satoshi Nakamoto sounded so interesting that Hal Finney started communicating with Nakamoto. On January 3, 2009, Nakamoto mined the first public Bitcoin block, the so-called "Genesis Block". Since then, on January 3, Bitcoin's birthday has been celebrated. 

On January 8, 2009, Nakamoto released the first version of the Bitcoin software. 

Hal Finney was the first after Nakamoto to install the software on his computer, he famously tweeted "Running Bitcoin" on January 11, 2009 and received a transaction. Hal Finney sadly died of a nerve disease sometime later. Did he know who was hiding behind the pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto?

I spoke to someone who was saved from starvation in Venezuela between 2016 to 2019 thanks to Bitcoin. Bitcoin literally saves lives! What can be more useful than that?

**Mobile Wallets**
For iOS and Android
* [Blockstream Green](https://blockstream.com/green/) (Bitcoin non-custodial, Liquid)
* [Breez Wallet](https://breez.technology/) (Lightning non-custodial)
* If you want to use Bitcoin and micro-payments on the Lightning Network:
* [Muun Wallet](https://muun.com/) (Bitcoin and Lightning non-custodial)
* [Blue Wallet](https://bluewallet.io/) (Bitcoin non-custodial and Lightning custodial)
* [Electrum](https://electrum.org) (Bitcoin and Lightning non-custodial, for more tech-savvy users)

**Desktop Wallets**
Because of the security risks stated above, I don't use software wallets on my computer, except for when I use them in combination with hardware wallets. For this, I use Electrum or the hardware manufacturer's native software.

deleted this paragraph:
Some hardware wallets (none of the above) use Bluetooth as a connection method. I advise against this because Bluetooth technology is considered relatively unsafe. It is better to connect the hardware wallet with the supplied USB cable.

**Seed**

12-24 words that in most of the wallets available in the market (HD wallets), produce all the private/public keys which will control your funds on the blockchain. Anyone with the seed has the control over these keys and therefore, over the funds on the associated addresses.
