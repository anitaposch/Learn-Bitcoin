A few hours ago I was live on Twitter Spaces together with 20,000 Bitcoiners and the President of El Salvador when the country's congress voted to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, making it the world's first country to do so. Coincidentally I am also finishing the manuscript of this book today. What an incredible time to be alive and I'm humbled to be able to contribute to this movement through my Bitcoin education. By picking up this book and sharing it with your friends we are hastening the monetary revolution towards more individual freedom and sovereignty.
