## Wallet Navigator
There are a variety of wallet providers and more are being released over time. You have to decide whether you want one that is for Bitcoin only or one for multiple coins. Each wallet offers different functionalities, security levels and support levels for different sets of coins. The following questions will help you to choose the basic type of wallet that will be suited to your needs. You will still need to research which manufacturer supports which coins.

### Step 1 - Select Wallet
**Would you like to be able to pay with the wallet on a regular basis?**
If you neither use a mobile phone nor computer and do not want to send payments, you can use the Card Wallet. You can send bitcoin or ether to it and save them. As soon as you want to pay it out, you will need to install a wallet. If you do want to make regular payments, then a software wallet, possibly in combination with hardware authentication like a Trezor or BitBox02 is more appropriate.

**Do you want to keep software and a device up-to-date?**
No? Then, again, the Card Wallet is the correct choice for you. You do not have to worry about maintaining a device.

**The amount you plan to have on the wallet will be...**
*Similar to the regular wallet in your pocket*: usually a mobile wallet is sufficient. It's free of charge and sufficient for small amounts.

*Similar to your bank account*: use a hardware wallet. Hardware wallets are highly sought after in Bitcoin bull runs and often sold out (keep this in mind in your schedule).

There is an [extended helper on the Bitcoin.org website](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet, that you can use too. It guides you through the selection based on the operating system (mobile, desktop, hardware wallet) you choose.

### Step 2 - Make a Backup Of Your Keys
Write down the mnemonic seed - 12 to 24 English words, the name, type and software version of your wallet and store them in a safe place.

### Step 3 - Buy Bitcoin
Most wallets include the ability to buy bitcoin directly within their interface. Wallet manufacturers are cooperating with exchanges, which in return pay them a commission. If I need to use an exchange I prefer selecting one prior and externally from the wallet. That way I stay independent of the wallet type, can use this one exchange to send bitcoin to all my different wallets, and only have to leave my KYC data in that one exchange, reducing the risk of data breaches. Using non-custodial, non-KYC methods is even better.
