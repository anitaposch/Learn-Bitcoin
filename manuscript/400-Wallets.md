## Wallet Types

There are different types of wallets depending on the device, security requirements and supported cryptocurrencies. To decide which wallet is best for you I will provide some thoughts and industry standards as guidance. Ultimately, you have to decide which wallet is the best for you. Since Bitcoin is such a novel technology, wallet software is changing constantly. You need to consider that you will need to do upgrades and sometimes change the wallet manufacturer because of new functionalities, there are constantly new wallets on the market. This should not turn you off, I just want to make you aware of it. In the last few years, I used more and more wallets to test them or to be able to use new functionalities. Therefore I will recommend wallets that I have used myself and that have a very good reputation among industry experts.

### Wallet Security

The better protected a wallet's software is from outside attacks over the internet, the more secure it is. Therefore, the basic categorization is between hot storage and cold storage solutions. Hot wallets, like mobile wallets and desktop wallets, are apps that connect to the internet and are therefore at risk from hackers, viruses or regulatory and counter-party risks. Cold storage solutions like hardware wallets are never online and therefore are much more secure.

Additionally, your smartphone, whether Android or iOS, is more secure than your laptop or PC. Desktop Windows systems are less secure than Apple devices at the time of writing. Within the different smartphone operating systems, there are fewer differences in the level of security.

On top of these considerations, you need to use a wallet that supports your favorite cryptocurrencies. Since this is a BTC guide, I suggest you use a bitcoin-only wallet. The more cryptocurrencies a software such as a wallet app has to handle, the more complex the development and maintenance of the software is from the manufacturer's end. More complexity brings higher risks of bugs and vulnerabilities.

In the years since Bitcoin's release, using a hardware wallet has proven to be the best way to store your private keys. A hardware wallet is a small device that stores private keys offline, similar to a USB stick.

Hardware wallets require maintenance and a computer or smartphone. If you don't want to worry about software updates, or do not own such a device, you can use the Card Wallet as a cold storage alternative. It is a product by the oldest Austrian bitcoin broker Coinfinity and the Austrian State Printing House.

### Industry Standards
In each case, you need to trust the wallet manufacturers to a higher or lesser degree. The **industry's preferred and recommended cold storage solutions are hardware wallets**.

Depending on the amount your wallet has to manage, it is standard to use a combination of **a smartphone wallet for small amounts that you want to have with you on the go** and **hardware wallets for large amounts like savings in your bank account**.

If your bitcoin funds reach an amount that you would rather have secured to an even higher degree, then you should look for multi-signature solutions. But be aware: Multi-sig solutions are **not for beginners**! You really need to know what you are doing.

As an alternative, you can use a company called Casa and their industry-leading multi-sig solutions. Or you can get several hardware wallets to split your funds onto more devices, which lowers the risk of device or manufacturer flaws.

**Desktop Wallets**
Because of the security risks stated above, I don't use software wallets on my computer, except for when I use them in combination with hardware wallets. For this, I use Sparrow or the hardware manufacturer's native software.

### Cold Storage
**Hardware Wallets**

Hardware wallets manage your coins, bitcoin addresses and associated private keys without them ever "touching" the internet. Even if your device is virus-contaminated or has been hacked, your funds are safe and you can send and receive payments. You need to manually confirm transactions on these external devices - this ensures that no intruder on your computer can take over your funds.

The following manufacturers and devices have recently established themselves in the hardware wallet market in recent years. SatoshiLabs from Prague has been producing hardware wallets since 2012. The company Ledger from Paris was founded in 2014. SHIFT Cryptosecurity from Zurich has been on the market since 2015 and Canadian company Coinkite has been in the Bitcoin space since 2012.

* [Trezor One, Model T](https://anita.link/trezor) - SatoshiLabs https://anita.link/trezor
* [Ledger Nano S, Nano X](https://anita.link/ledger) - Ledger https://anita.link/ledger
* [Coldcard (for tech-savvy users)](https://anita.link/coldcard) - Coinkite https://anita.link/coldcard

The Coldcard is different to the other models because it is an air-gapped device - it can be used without ever being connected to a computer. That's why some people refer to it as cold-cold storage, being even more secure. For novices, I recommend one of the first three company's devices.

Never buy a hardware wallet from strangers on eBay or Amazon, and of course, don't buy it second hand. Always purchase it directly from the manufacturer's website, the manufacturer's Amazon page or a dealer you trust. Make sure that the device is sealed as stated on the manufacturer's website. Most of the recommended devices above have tamper-evident packaging to make sure that the device is used for the first time and has not been manipulated. Ledger deliberately chooses not to use anti-tamper seals on its packaging because they can potentially be counterfeited. Genuine Ledger devices contain a secure chip that prevents physical tampering and allows users to verify the software and hardware integrity using Ledger's guides. In any case: no manufacturer is sending the seed with the device!

In addition to the device, the vendor provides wallet software to manage your coins. For privacy reasons, many users take the vendor wallet only to do the initialization and backup of the device (write down the seed) and for firmware updates. After that, they use a wallet like Electrum for managing the coins.

**Offline wallets**
**Paper Wallet**
On the internet, you will find recommendations for using paper wallets. They are self-generated bitcoin addresses with their private and public keys that you can print out on paper. Since you generate and print them out yourself, you do not have to spend money on them. But, they are difficult to generate securely. The security measures that you need to take are extremely high. **I advise against using them**.

Really, if you do not want to pay the 50 - 100 USD required to buy a hardware wallet to secure higher amounts than you carry around comfortably on your phone, then you should reconsider using bitcoin as a store of value in the first place.

If you simply cannot afford a hardware wallet, use your phone in the meantime. As soon as you have saved enough funds, get yourself a hardware wallet.

**Card Wallet**
The Card Wallet (product) is in principle a paper wallet, but it is produced by professionals with high security standards. However, you need to trust the manufacturers to not record the private keys to the card. You can use the Card Wallet as an alternative if you do not own a computer or smartphone or do not want to take care of the maintenance of your hardware wallet. https://cardwallet.com/anita (my readers get 20% off)

The industry preferred and **recommended cold storage solution are hardware wallets**.
